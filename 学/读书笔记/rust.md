> There are multiple trade-offs to consider, in addition to the prevention of bugs. For example, in cases where youâ€™re using large data structures, mutating an instance in place may be faster than copying and returning newly allocated instances. With smaller data structures, creating new instances and writing in a more functional programming style may be easier to reason about, so the lower performance might be a worthwhile penalty for gaining that clarity.


> We split the types into two subsets: scalar and compound.

- A scalar type represents a single value.
- Compound types can group multiple values of other types into one type. Rust has two primitive compound types: tuples and arrays.

> Throughout this section, keep in mind that Rust is a statically typed language, which means that it must know the types of all variables at **compile time**.

> Arrays are useful when you want your data allocated on the stack rather than the heap
